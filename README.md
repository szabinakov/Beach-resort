# Getting Started with Create React App

Built a Beach Resort Home page with a [freecodecamp tutoria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXJOvkVYQqA)

## Details

- The app has a Home page and a Room page, the data I have worked with is not external, it is included in the repo.
- You are able to filter the rooms by type, number of people allowed, price, size, included breakfast and allowed or not allowed pets.

###### Just to make it a little bit more mine, I have changed some of the class component to functional ones

###### In this tutorial I have learnt about <em>React.Context</em> and <em>Styled-Components</em> for the first time.

#### Built With:

- React
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- Styled Components
- React Router Dom
- React Icons
